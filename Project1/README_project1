In this project we program a game called `Yahtzee`.
The game involves 5 dice and a scorepad. On a player's turn, they roll the 5 dice together. 
Then they may choose to re-roll any number of dice and then again. 
After 3 rolls (or less if they choose), they cannot roll the dice anymore. 
It is time to look at the values shown on the top of the 5 dices with several ways to score.

The scoring schemes is :                            score calculation:
3 of a kind                                         sum of all 5 dices
4 of a kind                                         sum of all 5 dices
Full House (3 of a kind and a pair)                 fixed score 25
Small Straight (4 dices with consequtive values)    fixed score 30
Large Straight (5 dices with consequitive values)   fixed score 40
YAHTZEE (5 dice showing the same value)             fixed score 50
Chance (nothing special)                            sum of 5 dices

We need three classes of RandomNumber.java to generate dice face in each rolling, Dice.java, and Yahtzee.java for calcuating the scores.
TestGame.java includes some test cases to assure the calculations are correct.
