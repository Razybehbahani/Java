# Java
Here are samll projects I have worked on.

Project 1 - Programming a game named `Yahtzee`, in which a player rolls a dice 5 times and their score is calculated based on the up face of the rolled dices.

Project 2 - Programming a game named `Wordle`, in which a player has 5 guesses to find a `mystery` word. They can improve their next guessses based on the labels given to the previous guesses.

Project 3 - Programing a path in a mysterical pyramid to find a number of treasures. The pyramid is divided into interconnected hexagonal chambers and we need to find a path from entrance chamber to all treasure chambers, by avoiding some trapped chambers, and considering defined priorities for the next steps.

Project 4 - Will come soon.
