- using loops and conditionals

In this project we are going to code a word game named Wordle. Playing this game you have 6 guesses to find a 5-letter word. With each guess, you get information about how the letters of your guess relate to a `mystery word`. Each letter in your guess is labeled with respect to a mystery word as a `correct` letter, a `used` letter, or an `unused` letter. For instance, if the mystery word was “WHILE” but your guess was “SHEET”, then the labelling would be as follows: S unused, H correct, E used, E used, and T unused. That information can inform the next guess.  


We have the following classes:
Letter.java
Word.java
WordLL.java
LinearNode.java
ExtendedLeter.java
WordLLExamples.java
Main.java
TestWordLL.java   for testing functionality of different methods
